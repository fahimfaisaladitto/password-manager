• Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for rapid layout and component styling.

• JavaScript (ES6): Powers all the application's interactive logic, including:

    • The dynamic password validation engine.

    • Real-time updates to the UI based on user input.

    • Managing the dark mode state and saving it to localStorage.

# Project Structure
<h4 align="left">The project is organized into three separate files for clean code and easy maintenance.</h4>

• index.html: Contains the core HTML structure of the web application and links to the external CSS and JavaScript files.

• style.css: Holds all the custom CSS, including theme variables for light/dark modes, animations, and component-specific styles.

• script.js: Contains all the JavaScript code that drives the application's functionality, from handling user input to managing the dynamic rule list.

# Setup and Installation
<h4 align="left">Since this project uses basic web technologies with no external dependencies (other than CDN links), the setup is straightforward. </h4>

• Clone or Download: Get a copy of all three files (index.html, style.css, and script.js).

• Keep Files Together: Ensure that all three files are located in the same folder or directory.

• Open in Browser: Right-click the index.html file and choose "Open with" your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

<h4 align="left">That's it! The application will be running locally on your machine. </h4>
